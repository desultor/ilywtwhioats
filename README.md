Purpose
-----
Given a string of letters, construct an acrostic of bird names!


Caveats
---
No single-word bird names start with the letters "q", "u", or "x". I have added "Quetzal", "Xenornis", and "Upupa" so that we can provide an acrostic for any string of letters.

Performance gets too slow for longer strings, and memory runs out! I may need to do this depth-first, spitting out lines as I calculate them.
